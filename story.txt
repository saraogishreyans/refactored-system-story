There was once of a dog named Archit who wondered around a town named Spindale.
He had no owner and he was always happy- he had no complains with his life
until he saw another dog who had an owner and was treated always well in
his life. What Archit didn't see the good things he had in his own life- 
how he enjoyed his own freedom rather than rather than being on a leash his
entire life.

Mark Wu:
One day Archit left its community to another community called Madison and in there 
he met a girl puppy called Judy. And every time Archit felt boring and want enjoyed
your life he'll go to Madison.
