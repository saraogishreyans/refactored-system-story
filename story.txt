There was once of a dog named Archit who wondered around a town named Spindale.
He had no owner and he was always happy- he had no complains with his life
until he saw another dog who had an owner and was treated always well in
his life. What Archit didn't see the good things he had in his own life- 
how he enjoyed his own freedom rather than rather than being on a leash his
entire life.

Mark Wu:
One day Archit left its community to another community called Madison and in there 
he met a girl puppy called Judy. And every time Archit felt boring and want enjoyed
your life he'll go to Madison.

Kaylee Bittner:
Archit liked living in Madison and spending time with Judy. They would chase each other
around various local parks, watch the ducks on Lake Mendota, and beg for treats from
friendly strangers. He no longer envied dogs who had owners, and found that he was
happy roaming around the city with his friend Judy.

But happiness did not last long. Judy was caught by the Wild Animal Control. Archit
was so sad, and he was also angry. He thought life would be meaningless without
Judy, so de decided to rescue her. However, he did not know how to, so he seeked
help from the expert, Snowball the white rabbit.
